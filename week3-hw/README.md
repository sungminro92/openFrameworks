## Concept Descriptions


### Project 1

a narrative using primitive shapes
My first project will be a story telling about my experience of being able to call many cities home. It will be abstract illustration / movement of shapes and elements reveal the feelings. Some people are sometimes scared of leaving their hometown for travel, some people are not encouraged to move to different cities. I want my audience to experience the positive energy about multi-culutral in different areas on the earth. The main transition between scenecs will be made based on the rotation of the earth element. In the end, I want to include an important message that we are living on the same planet and we are all neighbors no matter what.

### Project 2

1) With weather API: My plan is to obtain a visual representation of weather forecast that engage physical human interaction on the screen. I imagine of having users to navigate through different dates, and based on a specific date, there will be a forecast screen using color representation


2) With quotes API ( if approved ): I want to play with random quotes provided from the API and create a visualization based on the words that are being used in the sentence. And when you select the word bubble, then you navigate into a scene where you can view all the available quotes about that word


### Project 3

I want to create a mini series of speed games based on colors, numbers, words and visuals, and with sound.
(further details to be determined...!)
