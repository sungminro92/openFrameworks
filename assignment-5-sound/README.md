## Assignment 5

### Description
I created four different characters that shows different movements and play different sounds for two seconds.

For the first character, it's playing South Korea's traditional song as the character dances.

Second scene is playing bird sound as it represents sun set at Mount Raininer, Seattle.

Third scene is an Empire State Building with sparkling lights on that symbolize New York City, and it plays a twinkle & glittery sound

Last scene is showing an Earth with a house in the middle, with a fun movement, and plays 'yay!' sound. It represents that we are all neighbors on the earth.
