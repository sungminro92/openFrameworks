#### Hello my name is Sungmin Ashley Ro. 

Reminiscing what simply made me happy as a young child - investigating new things, engaging in new activities and finding new secret places - my passion is to explore more creations. </br>
I am currently a first-year graduate student at Parsons, studying design immersed in technology that promotes human activity.
As much as I love art and technology, I enjoy eating, hiking, snowboarding, and singing!
