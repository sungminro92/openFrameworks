### Description
This week, I made a few changes to the Project1, based on the feedback I received last class.


Feedback I received last week:

- add more information to the flight scenes

- hour change to "Westcoast to Eastcoast" scene

- why word puzzles? specify why these interaction is needed. put meanings.
