You're able to control gui panel to manipulate the followings:

- Background color to represent how hot it is ( based on 'current temperature')

- Number of clouds to represent cloudiness ( based on 'cloud cover' )

- Opacity of the clouds to represent Humidity ( based on 'humidity' )

- Movement of the clouds to represent how fast the wind is blowing ( based on 'wind speed' )

- Position of the sun to represent current time compared to sunrise and sunset time

- Visibility of the sun to represent how clear it is ( based on 'visibility' )
